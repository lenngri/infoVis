To run this project,...

## Features
to be implemented

### To Do

- a colorpleth of europe with visual encoding for both patent registrations as well as R&D expenditure
    → overview of european situation
- a bubble chart of patent registrations, R&D expenditure and GDP by country 
    → comparison and pattern recognition
- detail on demand: patent categories are shown as pie chart / stacked bar chart
- time travel: slider which lets someone control the displayed year + possibility to autoplay
